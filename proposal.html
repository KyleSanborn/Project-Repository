    <h1>Project Proposal </h1>
    <p> My website is about the New York Rangers professional hockey team.</p>
    <p> The objective of this website is to share information and updates about the New York Rangers as the NHL playoffs are right around the corner.</p>
    <p> My website is for any and all New York Rangers fans and hockey fans in general. The New York Rangers have not made the NHL playoffs since
        2017, so it is specifically for people interested in their current playoff hunt!</p>
        <hr />
    <h2> I plan to have a page dedicated to each of the following: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Recent game results</li>
        <li>Season statistics for the team as a whole</li>
        <li>Player statistics for each player</li>
        <li>Franchise playoff history</li>
        <li>Upcoming Schedule</li>
    </ul>
